The Public Service Commission (PSC) will this morning give a briefing on an investigation into why employers do not implement labour related court orders and the impact thereof. The PSC received enquiries and complaints from employees regarding the non-implementation of arbitration awards and Labour Court orders by government departments. The PSC then conducted an investigation into the complaints. In today’s briefing, the PSC will release its findings. In addition, it will give recommendations to the affected government departments. The PSC has warned against failure to implement arbitration awards and compliance with court orders, as this has serious implications on the management of labour relations, human resources and development in general. The period under investigation is for awards and court orders issued during the 2013/14 and 2015/16 financial years. - SAnews.gov.za
