If the media doesn t report, how will the government know what the people are thinking? They will sit in a dark room and create their own reality, he said.The AGM was dominated by discussions on the threat of so-called fake news, cyber bulling and physical threats to journalists.Sanef expressed its outrage at the death threats received by investigative journalists Sipho Masondo (City Press) and Mzilikazi wa Afrika (Sunday Times) in recent months.The AGM agreed to urgently request a meeting with Police Minister Fikile Mbalula and the acting national commissioner of the SAPS, Lt-Gen Lesetja Mothiba to discuss these and other threats to and the intimidation of journalists.The AGM further identified the weaponisation of social media as an immediate threat to the credibility and safety of journalists.Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are being used by nefarious forces to bully, harass and threaten professional journalists doing their jobs.
