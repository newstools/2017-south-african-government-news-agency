Pretoria The City of Cape Town has reminded residents to continue using water sparingly and only for permitted essential use, irrespective of the rainfall that is currently being experienced in the province.According to the City, all water users must continue to reduce their water usage to less than 100 litres per person per day.The City says the much-anticipated cold front which has made landfall is not a quick ticket out of the drought situation. It will take at least three consecutive winters of above-average rainfall to make a real difference.The City urges consumers, where possible, to use suitable containers to capture rainwater, which is perfect for flushing toilets, as an example. Flushing an average toilet could save nine litres per flush depending on the type of toilet. It must be noted that, due to climatic unpredictability, no one is able to definitely predict when our next big rainfall will occur. We must therefore continue to save water now and we cannot afford to have our water use influenced by the weather using less than 100 litres per person per day whether at home, work, school or elsewhere remains the requirement, said the City s Mayoral Committee Member for Informal Settlements, Water and Waste Services and Energy, Councillor Xanthea Limberg.The City has made provision to capture some of the excessive inflows at wastewater treatment works by diverting it to maturation or retention ponds where available.There are critical points in the sewer reticulation system where storm water is diverted to the sewer system.This water is treated to make more treated effluent available. Investigation is under way to see how to capture urban storm water at a greater scale and then store it for later treatment and use.In addition, the City assures all residents that drinking water remains safe to drink as rigorous and regular tests are conducted to maintain the high level of water quality.The City is running an exhibition at Canal Walk to showcase water-saving technologies from 9 11 June 2017.All residents who want to explore ways in which they can conserve water are encouraged to attend.Residents can contact the City via email to water@capetown.gov.za for queries or to report contraventions of water restrictions (evidence should be provided to assist the City s enforcement efforts), or they can send an SMS to 31373.For further information on how to adhere to the less than 100 litre usage requirement, residents are advised to visit the water restrictions page on the City s website: www.capetown.gov.za/thinkwater.
