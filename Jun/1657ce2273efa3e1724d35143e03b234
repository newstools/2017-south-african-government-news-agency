Pretoria - The MEC for Local Government and Human Settlements in the North West, Galaletsang Gaolaolwe, has condemned the incident in which a group of people set alight the offices of Mamusa Local Municipality in Schweizer Reneke.The incident happened just before lunch time on Thursday after a group of people demanded the reinstatement of an official, who was deployed to act as municipal manager until the appointment of a substantive municipal manager. We are deeply disturbed that we still have people who voice their frustration in a violent manner by destroying public infrastructure, as it has happened in Mamusa. No amount of anger justifies the torching of municipal offices. On behalf of the provincial government, I want to appeal to law enforcement agencies to apprehend the perpetrators, said MEC Gaolaolwe.
