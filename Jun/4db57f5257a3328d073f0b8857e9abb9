Pretoria The Department of Correctional Services says 13 officials will be served with letters of contemplation of suspension following the explicit entertainment at the Johannesburg Correctional Centre. At this stage, the preliminary findings indicate that at least 13 officials will be served with letters of contemplation of suspension, said acting National Commissioner James Smalberger on Monday.According to the preliminary report received, illicit images were taken at an event hosted at the centre during Youth Month Commmorations on 21 June at Johannesburg Medium B Correctional Centre.He said the department is currently investigating reports of the images circulating on social media of ladies dressed in what looks like underclothes seen to be entertaining inmates at the Johannesburg Correctional Centre.He said the department condemns the incident with the contempt that it deserves.The Commissioner said the management of the event should have never allowed and should have halted the explicit entertainment as it is against the department s policies. This type of conduct is unacceptable, particularly in a correctional facility where security is of paramount importance. We want to make it abundantly clear that we will leave no stone unturned in dealing with this matter, said Commissioner Smalberger.According to Smalberger, the investigation is being led by a senior official at the level of a Director who is not from the Johannesburg Correctional Centre. On behalf of DCS, we want to apologize to the citizens of South Africa for this incident which, indeed, is very disturbing. We will make sure that those found guilty face the consequences of their actions, and also that sufficient measures are in place to ensure that such incidents are not repeated, Smalberger said.
