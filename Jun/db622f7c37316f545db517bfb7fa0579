Pretoria - The Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) will host the national Africa Public Service Day (APSD) celebrations in Pretoria on Friday. The celebrations will be held under the continental theme, ‘Entrenching a citizen-centred service delivery culture, partnering with the youth for Africa’s transformation’. The theme is in line with the African Union’s 2063 Agenda, the objective of which is for Africans to have a continent that puts its citizens at the centre of all programmes. “The local APSD is more significant, as it coincides with Youth Month, which is commemorated in June. It provides South Africans with an opportunity to take stock of the strides made in addressing issues facing the youth,” DPSA said. The celebrations will include roundtable discussions, in which public service stakeholders will participate. The event will provide an opportunity to pin-point some of the challenges impeding the public service in living up to citizens’ expectations. Different government departments will be at the event to showcase their services, good practices and innovation through exhibitions. The continental commemoration of APSD will be held in Kigali, Rwanda, from Wednesday, 21 June to Friday, 23 June. – SAnews.gov.za
