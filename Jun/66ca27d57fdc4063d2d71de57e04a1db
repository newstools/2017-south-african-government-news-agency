Pretoria - President Jacob Zuma has extended his condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the storm that struck the Western Cape on Wednesday.Speaking at the presentation of Letters of Credence by new Heads of Mission accredited to South Africa at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria, President Zuma shared words of comfort with those grieving the loss of their loved ones, and those whose lives have been turned upside down by the mega storm. Our hearts go out to those who have also lost their belongings, including their homes, he said.The President said those living in informal settlements, which remain a challenge that government is attending to, have been worse affected yet again by the floods. We thank all who continue to provide support, from both government and the non-governmental sector, he said.He said while the Western Cape remains in dire need of rain, the storms have cause a lot of havoc.
