The largest contributor to municipal total operating expenditure was employee related costs (26.3%), followed by electricity purchases (22.6%), depreciation and amortisation (8.9%), other expenditure (8.2%), bad debts (6.7%), contracted services (5.9%), water purchases (5.6%), general expenditure (5.5%), repairs and maintenance (4.4%), interest paid (2.8%), grants and subsidies paid (2.0%) and remuneration of councillors (1.1%), Dr Lehohla said.According to the statistics, expenditure for metropolitan municipalities in 2016 was R175 billion compared to 2015 when it was R161 billion.The expenditure for local municipalities in 2016 was R115 billion compared to R107 billion in 2015, while expenditure for district municipalities was R209 billion last year and in 2015 it was R196 billion.Dr Lehohla said the cost structure of district municipalities differs from local and metros because they are organised differently. The main income source for metros is from sales of electricity and for local and district municipalities is from grants and subsidies. Salaries take quite a big chunk of local and metro municipalities, he said.About a quarter of the locals and metro municipalities expenditure is on salaries.The total employee related costs for 2016 was R81.8 billion compared to R73.4 in 2015.Employee related costs for 2016 in the metros was R45.9 billion, in local municipalities it was R29.0 billion and districts municipalities it was R6.9 billion. As at June 2016, municipalities owed their lenders, suppliers and other creditors a combined amount of R210.7million [which is] 7.5% more than what they owed as at 30 June 2015. The provinces which showed the highest percentage increase between 2015 and 2016 were Free State (27.6%), Northern Cape (17.9%) and Mpumalanga (9.0%), Dr Lehohla said.Purchases of electricity increased from R62.2 billion in 2015 to R70.3 billion in 2016, while sales of electricity reflected an increase from R85.6% billion in 2015 to R94 billion in 2016.
