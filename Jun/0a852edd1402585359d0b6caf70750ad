You cannot attempt to change a person s circumstances without first understanding them and who better to help us understand the struggles of the youth than those who face them every day. We have long believed that the traditional top-down approach is severely outdated and that if the pandemic is to be halted, a new approach should to be taken. It is clear that our current HIV/AIDS interventions are not adequately reaching our young people, especially in the TVET sector, he said.Deputy Minister Manana said he found the conference ground-breaking as it brought policy makers into direct contact with the real issues affecting young people. This allows for the co-creation of a solution for the HIV epidemic in South Africa. We must increase our efforts to tackle the pandemic, particularly in the higher education sector. Health issues undermine the achievement of South Africa s core educational outcomes and put the future of our country at risk, he said. - SAnews.gov.za
