Of the 12 000 companies that conduct business with our provincial administration, 10 000 of them are HDIs, including township enterprises. The number of township enterprises benefitting from public procurement policy has increased three fold from 800 in 2014 to more than 2 800 by January 2017. We have also continued to invest in economic infrastructure in the townships, including the refurbishment of industrial parks and providing broadband connectivity, establishment of ekasi labs for technology start-ups as well as training and skills development for township enterprises and SMMEs, Premier Makhura said.Since the start of the fifth administration in 2014, bi-annual employment has reached 317 000, thus breaking the ceiling of 300 000. We know full well that in order to significantly decrease unemployment, we need to double this number and reach at least 600 000 new jobs over a two-year period from 2017 till 2019. Gauteng has in the years 2014 and 2016 increased its spending on the township economy from R600 billion to R6 billion to reach its set target of 30% by 2019. The target to be reached by end of the current administration is 40%.Provincial Economic Development PlanThe rapid implementation of the new Provincial Economic Development Plan which has been embraced by all stakeholders will be the priority focus of Team Gauteng in partnership with municipalities and social partners this year. We are engaging in an amazing work of direct interaction with business leaders at firm-level and through what we call industry action labs to unlock the employment and empowerment potential of key sectors in our province, the Premier said.A Premier s Economic Advisory Panel which will be made up of economic experts, entrepreneurs and labour representatives will be formed.They will advise the Premier and the provincial government on implementing strategies to realise its objectives of increasing employment, empowerment, exports and inclusive growth in line with the vision set out in the National Development Plan and the Provincial Economic Plan. The new future-oriented economy is taking shape. We will be significant participants in the fourth Industrial Revolution. In addition to this, the province will also was focused on increasing trade and investment with major economies in Africa, fellow Brics countries, Asia-Pacific, Europe and the Americas.Maintenance of existing infrastructureAnother focus this year for the province will be maintenance of existing infrastructure, the lifeblood of the social and economic transformation agenda.Between 2013 and 2016, Gauteng s infrastructure investment amounted to R30 billion, translating into an average annual growth rate of 20.7% the fastest growth rate in the country. As we rollout the R42 billion infrastructure budget over the next three years, we need to ensure that there is a decisive shift to true empowerment of black firms so that they become more sustainable and more transformative so that they can contribute to industrialisation and local manufacturing initiatives, the Premier said.He added that the infrastructure investment must support the priority economic sectors and help to redress spatial imbalances in the five corridors to spread the benefits of re-industrialisation, employment and empowerment equitably across Gauteng.The Premier urged all municipalities to continue working with the province to deliver the state of the art infrastructure, create jobs and improve the quality all residents. As leaders representing all citizens, let us act in the public interest by resisting the temptation to assert authority by stopping projects Let us work together regardless of which party runs which government, to rollout infrastructure projects that are beneficial to all our citizens. Infrastructure projects in focus include public transport and logistics, mega human settlements, renewable energy, ICT and Broadband, water and sanitation, health infrastructure as well as new schools.The long awaited construction of mega human settlements and new cities will commence this year with 31 new mega human settlements. Both public and private sector partnerships will start in April in different corridors.
