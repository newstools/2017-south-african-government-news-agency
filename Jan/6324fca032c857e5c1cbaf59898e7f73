I sincerely hope that the municipalities take full advantage of the opportunity to make payments and the necessary arrangements towards the eradication of the overdue arrear amounts, said Koko.Eskom stressed that failure to honour the outstanding debt will compel it to reactivate electricity interruptions by issuing the schedule for the next round of interruptions of the affected municipalities on 1 February 2017.Minister Brown has expressed support for Eskom s debt recovery strategy. It is critical that Eskom recovers all its revenue to be able to honour obligations to its creditors in order to remain sustainable, she said.At Tuesday s briefing, Eskom announced that in the last nine months, it has connected 162 104 new customers to the grid, with 150 747 customers energised and already using electricity.
