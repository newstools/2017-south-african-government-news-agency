Pretoria A total of 5 504 022 people travelled across South Africa s borders between 9 December 2016 and 14 January 2017, says Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba.This marks an increase of 200 467 movements, or 3.78 percent, at the ports of entry nationally when compared to the 5 303 555 recorded between 9 December 2015 to 14 January 2016. The 2016/17 festive season was marked by increased movement of people and goods across borders for different reasons varying from cross-border employment and business to academic and educational endeavours. We also observed a high number of travellers crossing borders for holiday and tourist purposes, which is one of the important priorities for the country, said the Minister at a media briefing on the latest festive season traveller statistics in Pretoria on Wednesday.Minister Gigaba said South Africa remains an attractive tourist destination.The top 10 nationalities that arrived in South Africa during the period were from Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland, Botswana, United Kingdom, United States, Namibia, Germany and Zambia.The top 10 ports of entry used by travellers between 9 December 2016 and 14 January 2017 were Oliver Tambo International Airport, Beit Bridge, Lebombo, Maseru Bridge, Ficksburg, Cape Town International Airport, Oshoek, Kopfontein, Ramatlabama and Groblers Bridge.All movements for OR Tambo for the same period reached a total of 977 961, compared to 948 477 during 9 December 2015 to 14 January 2016.Minister Gigaba said it was imperative for ports to be well-prepared at all times to execute and facilitate traveller movement and to mitigate illegal movements and transgressions, especially during peak times.In a bid to ensure the smooth movement of travellers, additional personnel was deployed at OR Tambo International Airport during the festive season. Minister Gigaba said as a strategic hub, the airport requires additional resources on a permanent basis.In this regard, R25 million has been allocated for the 2017/18 financial year to enable the department to appoint an additional 58 immigration officials and fully capacitate the management team.A further increase in staff capacity is planned for the 2018/19 financial year with an additional budget allocation of R17 million.The Immigration Operational Centre at the National Office played a vital role in the success of port operations during the festive season. It resolved most of the challenges experienced at a tactical level. More importantly, the operational centre followed a sound escalating protocol to ensure that senior and executive management of the department were well informed of issues to allow for early responses to situations, Minister Gigaba said.
