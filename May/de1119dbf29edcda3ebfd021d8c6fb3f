Cape Town Communications Deputy Minister Tandi Mahamehlala says the Ministry will work with the production team of award-winning biopic Kalushi to screen the film in communities that could not afford to watch it in cinema.The Deputy Minister said this when she participated in the department s budget vote debate in the National Assembly on Friday.This was Deputy Minister Mahambehlala s maiden budget vote debate ever since she was recently appointed in the portfolio. I am pleased to announce that this Ministry will also play its part. Over the next couple of months, we will be working closely with the team to screen Kalushi in communities who traditionally would not have the means to view this film. In so doing, we educate communities about a fundamental part of our history and use it as an opportunity to share awareness on how film content is classified by the Films and Publications Board. We have a duty to support the producers of local content in the arts and other industries. In so doing, we draft our own narrative and also create jobs in local industries as well as a brand identity for our young democracy, she said.Kalushi is the life story of struggle icon Kalushi, also known as Solomon Mahlangu.Kalushi was a young man who stood up bravely against the Apartheid regime, and was hanged by the unjust apartheid regime in the gallows at Pretoria Central Prison on 6 April 1979.The film won the Best Film Award at the Luxor African Film Festival in Egypt.Lead actor Thabo Rametsi's portrayal of Kalushi earned him the Best Actor accolade at the BRICS International Film Festival in India.
