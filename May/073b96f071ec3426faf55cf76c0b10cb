Pretoria - Government’s plans for this year’s Youth Month commemorations are in full swing. June is celebrated as Youth Month in South Africa, with a specific focus on June 16, which is also known as Youth Day. Youth Month pays tribute to the school pupils who lost their lives during the 16 June 1976 uprising in Soweto. This year, the commemorations will be observed under the theme, ‘The Year of OR Tambo: Advancing Youth Economic Participation’, Cabinet said in a statement on Thursday. Over the month, government will host a number of engagements, including youth expos, dialogues and youth entrepreneur hubs to showcase opportunities available to young people and inspire them to instil the educational and leadership values of liberation hero OR Tambo. “Cabinet encourages all young people to access the various support and educational programmes that government has made available to improve their prospects and advance their participation in the economy,” the executive said in a statement. - SAnews.gov.za
