Pretoria - The Presidency says the former chairperson of the Board of the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA), Yershen Pillay, has served his full three-year term at the agency. This comes after reports that Pillay has been demoted by President Jacob Zuma when he appointed a new NYDA board this week. “This is a gross fabrication. Pillay served his full three-year term and completed it last year. Parliament then began a process of searching for new members of the Board of the NYDA, culminating in the recommendation of names to the President,” the Presidency said on Wednesday. Section 9(2) of the National Youth Development Agency Act, 2008, (Act 54 of 2008), empowers the President, on a recommendation of Parliament, to appoint members of the NYDA Board for a period of three years. While section 9(5) of the Act, allows the President to designate the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the NYDA Board, respectively. “There is no provision in the Act that requires the President to reappoint a member designated as the chairperson or deputy chairperson as such once their term of office lapses. Once a three-year period lapse, the new Board must be appointed,” the Presidency said. – SAnews.gov.za
