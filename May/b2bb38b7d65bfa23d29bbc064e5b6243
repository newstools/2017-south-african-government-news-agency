Pretoria Residents living in the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality will no longer have to travel over 20 kilometres to access government services, thanks to the newly launched uMnini Thusong Service Centre in KwaZulu-Natal.Addressing the launch of the centre on Friday, ahead of the Ministerial Imbizo, Public Service and Administration Minister Faith Muthambi said the centre is a government initiative that forms part of the broader national Presidential programme that seeks to provide a one-stop shop facility for various local and provincial government services. We have no doubt that the centre, as its primary purpose, will build the bridge between the government and citizens of this community, Minister Muthambi said.Services offered at the Thusong Service Centre include social services of the Department of Social Development, civic services from the Department of Home Affairs and there is an office of Ward 98 Councillor, which assists with issuing proof of residence letters and engagement with the ward committee on community matters. We will engage with government departments that still have to occupy the space demarcated for them in the centre such as the South African Police Services (SAPS), Department of Labour, Government Information Communication System (GCIS) and Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA). The presence of these departments in the centre will contribute to increasing service delivery points and thus ensure that citizens benefit by accessing more services within one Centre, Minister Muthambi said.The Minister further said government together with the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality will implement the e-Waste project which is expected to employ 100 young people.She said the project has the potential to upgrade to an intake of 500 people.The Minister assured community members that the South African government cared for its people and it will focus on service delivery.
