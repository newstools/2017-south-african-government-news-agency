We hope that the forum will discuss vigorously the issue of the development of Africa especially infrastructure development. We are also happy that leaders will look at youth development because Africa is a very youthful continent. Africa s large youth population presents the continent with an historic opportunity that must be fully taken advantage of. We will benefit from the youth dividend if young Africans are skilled, healthy, participating in a democracy as active citizens and participating in the productive labour force. We trust that delegates will ensure that opportunities for the youth remain foremost in their discussions, said President Zuma.The President said he was pleased that WEF in Africa 2017 would also focus specifically on issues that include education, skills and employment, entrepreneurship, energy, infrastructure and development finance, and also combating, adapting to and building resilience against climate change, and science, technology and innovation. - SAnews.gov.zaPretoria - The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (DENOSA) will host a two-day nurses meeting in preparation for the 21st International AIDS Conference.
