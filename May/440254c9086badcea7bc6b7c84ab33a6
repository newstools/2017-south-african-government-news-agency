Pretoria As winter gradually sneaks in, the Department of Water and Sanitation has appealed to consumers to use water sparingly and save it.The department reported that water is steadily dissipating from dams, causing the resource availability to diminish slowly. The core message is that all Water Service Authorities (WSAs) should implement Water Conservation and Water Demand Management strategies, while informing communities about the intended water restriction process, the department said in a statement.The department said that winter rainfalls are also of great concern as the country has not yet had any significant rain to relieve pressure on the dams. Water is dwindling steadily from the dams, with the prospects of another El Nino. This means each and every drop of water should be saved.
