Pretoria Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini has assured all qualifying social grants beneficiaries that they will receive their money on the 1st of April. The Department of Social Development and the South Africa Social Security Agency (SASSA) wishes to inform South Africans especially social grants recipients, that all is on track for the payment of grants from 1 April 2017, the department said on Sunday. Considering that 1 April 2017 is a Saturday and for this reason, as in all occasions when the grant payment date falls over a weekend, SASSA pay points will not open. Special focus and provision will be made for the busiest merchants and ATMs around the country and Regional Executive Managers will be deployed to monitor and assist beneficiaries with enquiries, the department said.On April 3, SASSA pay points will operate as normal and recipients are encouraged to go on their respective days and respective pay points as indicated on the slips they received last month.Teams of managers will also be deployed to provide assistance at the pay points.The department has emphasised that normal business processes will continue, so any form of lapsing or suspensions that may occur may not imply a failure to pay by SASSA. The Minister wishes to reiterate her unreserved apology for the anxiety and fear caused about the uncertainty around the payment of social grants. She wished to express her gratitude in advance for the patience and cooperation of South Africa especially the beneficiaries of social grants, the department said.Measures have been put in place to assist beneficiaries on 1 April.
