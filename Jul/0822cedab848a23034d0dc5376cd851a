Pretoria - South African Airways (SAA) on Wednesday marked 10 years of flying to Munich, Germany. The daily flights between Munich and Johannesburg are a significant part of our European network strategy and also an important connection for the industry and trade, as well as for tourism from Southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland, said SAA Head of Europe, Michael Bentele.Initially equipped with three weekly connections, the route quickly showed potential and was increased to daily flights in October 2007. Since then, the national carrier has been offering a connection from Munich to Johannesburg daily.Munich is a central hub of Star Alliance -- a body that SAA has been a member for over 10 years -- and offers excellent onward connections, especially to Southern and Eastern Europe.Bentele said the Airbus A340-600, which has more capacity, will be deployed on the route again. SAA is currently flying with the new Airbus A330-300. From the beginning, Munich Airport (Flughafen M nchen GmbH) has been an exceptional partner, and a comprehensive network in various fields was established, of which the sister airport agreement with the Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) is an important part, said Bentele.The daily connection leaves Munich at 9:05pm and reaches Johannesburg at 7:40am the next morning. The return flight departs from Johannesburg at 8:35pm and lands in Munich at 7:20 am.
