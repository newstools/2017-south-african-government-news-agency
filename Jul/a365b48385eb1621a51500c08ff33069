Pretoria The National Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC) has introduced new builder registration and enrolment certificates as a means of reducing fraud in the sector. NHBRC Business Services Executive, Thitinti Moshoeu, said the council has enhanced the security features of the new certificates based on industry standards. This following a number of reported fraudulent activities, which posed a risk to the warranty fund. The new security measures include an embedded watermark during paper manufacturing; chemically sensitive paper; micro printed text; background image printed with fine line security and control numbers done with an ink that cannot be rubbed off, Moshoeu said. He urged homeowners, including potential home buyers and financial institutions, to familiarise themselves with the enhanced certificates and continue to exercise caution when dealing with contractors, developers and builders. He said the public must ensure that they verify builder registration and home enrolment with the NHBRC.
