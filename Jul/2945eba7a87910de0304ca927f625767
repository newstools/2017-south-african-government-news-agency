The campaign will be held in Port Elizabeth, Queenstown and East London.

With this campaign, we firstly aim to engage with members of the public, educate them about the implications of these acts on their daily lives and also promote a culture of activism, and exercising their rights using these pieces of legislation as their last line of defence, said Minister Davies. Well-informed and equipped officials are part of the campaign to field questions from the public on the legislation. We do look forward to extensive and educational engagements with the public and hope that at the conclusion of this campaign we will have empowered citizens with the know-how to do what is right for them and their communities, said the Minister.The campaign began in Limpopo last month. - SAnews.gov.zaPretoria - The Department of Trade and Industry (dti) has called on companies in the agro-processing sector to apply to participate in the 7th Investment and Trade Initiative (ITI) to the Democratic Republic of Congo.Pretoria - Economic Counsellor for the South African High Commission in Tanzania, Frans van Aardt, says South Africa and Tanzania must work to address the trade imbalance between the two countries.Pretoria South African companies taking part in the Department of Trade and Industry s Outward Selling Mission in Kenya have identified business opportunities in the east African country.
