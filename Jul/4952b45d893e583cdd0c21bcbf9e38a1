Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor has expressed sadness at the passing of Ronnie Mamoepa and conveyed her condolences to his wife, family, friends and colleagues.Mamoepa, who was spokesperson to Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, died after complications arising from a stroke he suffered last month. He was 56. I fondly remember Ronnie as a very capable and professional head of communications at the Department of Home Affairs. We worked closely together drawing on his ideas for broadening communications and serving the public. His stories of life as an activist and his experience as a cadre in prison kept us entranced for hours, we dip our heads in sadness at this loss of another great South African. May his soul rest in peace, said the Minister.Mamoepa was a highly regarded accomplished public servant and veteran communicator, who served the African National Congress and various departments in government with distinction.In his latest role, since 2014, Mamoepa served as spokesperson for the deputy president.Details of memorial events will be made known as soon as they are finalised with the Mamoepa family.
