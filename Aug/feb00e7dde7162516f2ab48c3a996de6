The University of South Africa (UNISA) says it is working hard to deliver outstanding study material. UNISA Principal and Vice Chancellor, Professor Mandla Makhanya, said the university is currently communicating directly with affected students about the delay in some of their study material. Makhanya said the delay is due to an unexpected increase in student registration for the 2017 academic year. “All outstanding study material will be delivered to the affected students as soon as possible. Items weighing less than one kilogramme will be distributed via the South African Post Office (SAPO) ordinary mail as per legislation,” said Makhanya. In the meantime, Makhanya urged students to access their outstanding study material via myUnisa. Makhanya said by accessing study material via myUnisa, students will be able to start studying immediately, which will ensure that they have sufficient time to complete and submit their assignments. “We understand the student frustrations regarding the delay and we sincerely convey our apologies for the inconvenience,” Makhanya said. – SAnews.gov.za
