Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday paid a courtesy call on Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who is on a State visit to South Africa.The meeting between the two leaders took place at the Johnny Makhatini Diplomatic Guesthouse in Waterkloof, Tshwane.President Johnson Sirleaf was hosted by President Jacob Zuma at the Union Buildings earlier today.At the guesthouse, the leaders shook hands and held a short discussion before leaving the premises.Deputy President Ramaphosa was accompanied on the courtesy call by Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini and International Relations and Cooperation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane.President Johnson Sirleaf, who is the African continent s first female President, is in the country at a time when South Africa is commemorating Women s Month.Her visit comes two days after a successful National Women s Day commemoration, which was held in Galeshewe, Kimberly, on Wednesday.Her visit to South Africa is an important vehicle for economic growth and cooperation between the two countries, and will further contribute to strengthening intra-trade relations on the continent of Africa.Relations between South Africa and the West African country go back to 1997. The late former President Nelson Mandela paid a visit to that country in 1962.Earlier at the Union Buildings, Presidents Zuma and Johnson Sirleaf agreed to deepen cooperation between the two countries across a number of fields. This visit has afforded us an opportunity to review a wide range of bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual interest. It is pleasing to note that we are of the same mind in relation to how and what our Continent and, of course, the world should look like, said President Zuma.However, the two countries have acknowledged that economic relations, especially in terms of trade, are not at the level they can be. Although economic activities between our countries are still at a relatively low level, there are ample opportunities for our countries to further expand economic relations, said President Zuma, who also urged more private sector companies to invest in Liberia.Currently, the major South African businesses that have large investments in Liberia are MTN and DSTV.
