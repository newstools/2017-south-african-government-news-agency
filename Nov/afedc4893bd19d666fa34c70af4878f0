Trade and Industry Deputy Minister Bulelani Magwanishe is expected to launch a multimillion rand black industrialists firm expansion project in Limpopo next week. The Deputy Minister will launch Eastern Trading, a company trading as Dursots All Joy’s expansion project in Modjadjiskloof, Limpopo’, next Monday. The Department of Trade and Industry’s Black Industrialists Scheme (BIS) has approved funding for Eastern Trading to the value of R48 345 460 million. “The modern technology installed as a result of the funding obtained from the dti was used for processing tomato related food products and has enabled the company to triple its production. This manufacturing capability has made Eastern Trading competitive in relation to modern standards of manufacturing,” said Deputy Minister Magwanishe on Tuesday. The company has created 70 permanent jobs and 150 contract jobs in the area. As a result of the state-of-the-art machinery that has been installed through the support of the BIS grant, the company is projecting to create additional 275 jobs in the next two years. “Eastern Trading is one of the 70 companies that have benefited from the Black Industrialists Scheme since its launch in 2016. It is the third black industrialist project in the agro-processing value chain that the department is launching,” said the Deputy Minister. The BIS is a grant programme that aims to unlock the potential within black industrialists operating in the South African economy through deliberate, targeted and well-defined financial and non-financial support measures. Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies launched the R100 million tomato processing plant in May last year. Speaking at the launch, Minister Davies said agro-processing is an important sector in the South African economy, particularly in job creation, as it pushes South Africa closer to its goal of having more value-added products. – SAnews.gov.za
