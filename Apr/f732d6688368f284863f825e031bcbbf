Pretoria - South African Airways (SAA) has urged those who will be visiting family and friends over the Easter break to make their travelling a breeze by booking their flights early. As Easter approaches, South Africans across the country are making plans to visit family and friends, both locally and abroad. This is a particularly busy time of the year, when many people are travelling by road, rail and air, said the national carrier.SAA reminded travellers to have all their documentation with them before leaving home. If you are travelling to an international destination, you will need a valid passport with a minimum of two blank pages in it and a visa or visas, if required. If you are travelling within the country, either a passport or an ID document is acceptable as valid proof of identity. Bear in mind that if check-in and security staff are unable to identify you - or if you don t have valid visas for the countries you re travelling to - they may not accept you for travel, SAA said.Travellers must allow plenty of time to get to the airport and check in, taking into account possible delays on the roads or at the airport, especially during peak times.The carrier wished its passengers and all South Africans a safe and relaxed Easter.Meanwhile, newly appointed Home Affairs Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize last week announced that the department will be extending operating hours at selected ports of entry during the Easter weekend from 11 to 19 April 2017.Addressing the media at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, Minister Mkhize said an additional 200 Home Affairs officials will be deployed at various ports of entry during the Easter weekend.
