Midrand The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) is ready to administer the National Traffic Information and Vehicle Management System (eNatis).According to Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi, the RTMC has been ready to run the system since 2015. We are more than ready to run eNatis. We have trained staff at RTMC, personnel in provinces and municipalities, Minister Maswanganyi said.On Thursday, he addressed media in Midrand regarding the handover of eNatis by Tasima.This media briefing comes after two judgments by the Constitutional Court and the North Gauteng High Court, which ordered Tasima to hand over eNatis to the RTMC and vacate the premises. Tasima was on Tuesday, 4 April, ordered to handover eNatis within 30 days.eNatis provides registration for motor vehicles, motor trade numbers, accidents, vehicle manufacturers, importers and builders as well as driving licences and professional driving permits.It is also responsible for the register of infrastructure which includes authorised officers, instructors, driving licence testing centres, vehicle testing stations, examiners of vehicles and examiners of driving licences. It further provides for person and financial information, as well as system monitoring and evaluation. This is a critical system because South Africa has 12.2 million registered vehicles We have almost 310 000 taxis in this country and more than 61 000 buses. If the system is disrupted one day, it will have a serious socio-economic impact on the lives of South Africans, Minister Maswanganyi said.According to a statement issued by the Department of Transport, government will save about R30 million per month, thanks to the court order forcing the handover of eNatis. The court decision will also enable government to upgrade the system. We want to assure the public that the system will be secure and will not be disrupted, he said.Officials from the department have secured the system to prevent unauthorised access. SAnews.gov.za
