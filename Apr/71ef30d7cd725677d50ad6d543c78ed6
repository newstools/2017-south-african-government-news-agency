Pretoria - Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has refuted claims raised by the Democratic Alliance (DA) on behalf of beneficiaries, who reportedly did not get their social grants at Rabasotho Community Centre in Tembisa on Monday.According to the Minister, Rabasotho Community Centre was not scheduled for payment on Monday.Rabasotho Community Centre is scheduled for payment from April 4 - 7 and beneficiaries were given slips last month that clearly state dates and venues. The DA should have simply asked people for these slips or contacted the call centre for assistance, as was widely communicated. Members of Parliament, especially if they are members of the Portfolio Committee on Social Development, have a duty to give information and educate South Africans. The DA should have at least tried to find the correct information for the supposedly stranded beneficiaries," said Minister Dlamini.Social grants are paid over 15 days beginning on the first day of each month and payment will continue until April 17 in Gauteng. Social grants are paid through various channels including merchants, banks, points of sale, ATMs and South Africa Social Security Agency (SASSA) cash pay points.The Department of Social Development says beneficiaries, who have any challenges with grants, must call the SASSA call centre on 0800 60 10 11 to get assistance.By the end of April 1, SASSA had disbursed over R3.3 billion.With regard to deductions on grants, the Minister committed to following the Constitutional Court order to the latter.
