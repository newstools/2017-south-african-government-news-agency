Pretoria The Presidency has clarified that President Jacob Zuma did not cancel the memorial service of the late stalwart Ahmed Kathrada. The Presidency wishes to correct a wrong impression that has been created in the public domain that President Jacob Zuma cancelled the memorial service that he had declared for stalwart Mr Ahmed Kathrada. This is not true, the Presidency said on Saturday. President Zuma declared a Special Official Funeral for the late stalwart and directed government to organise an official memorial service to be addressed by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa on behalf of government. As is publicly known, the President did not attend the funeral and was not going to attend the memorial service either, respecting the wishes of the family. President Zuma was not involved in the planning of the memorial service and in the cancellation thereof, the Presidency said. The Presidency said any impression created that the President cancelled or ordered the cancellation is erroneous and unfortunate.
