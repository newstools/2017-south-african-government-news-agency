Let s adopt Zero Tolerance to initiation deaths. It is important to note that even when the initiates are at the initiation schools, parents are still the primarily responsible for their health, this is one role that they cannot outsource or delegate, the minister said on Saturday."Communities throughout the country are preparing their children for this sacred path of our people, in line with our different cultures.However this period is also characterized by the mushrooming of illegal initiation schools all over the country by unscrupulous people who aim to make money from this important traditional practice by abducting and kidnapping young men".The department committed to continue to work tirelessly with all stakeholders ahead, during and post the initiation season to ensure that they root out illegal initiation schools.Deputy Minister Obed Bapela said the department is working with all other stakeholders who will conduct unscheduled visits to a number of provinces as part of the interventions and monitoring.The random visits are part of the process and efforts to crack down and pounce on illegal initiations schools during this season.In addition, the department has called for provinces to strengthen their monitoring and coordinating forums so that they can remain vigilant and assist to identify and root out challenges inherent in the system.Emphasizing on the African proverb which says, It takes a village to raise a child , the deputy minister is of the view that without community involvement, government we will not be able to bring an end to the challenges around initiation. Remember, initiation is a societal issue and all problems emanating from it, are also societal problems.
